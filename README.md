# daeyegim-walking-pad-remote-codes

I lost the remote so I'm uploading the codes here for other people who might need it.


### How to pair the remote
Power on the walking pad while holding the start button for 5 seconds and it should beep.


### Recording
```
+ 
-
left 
right
M
Start
Stop
```

### TODO
- Somehow make the remote responsive, when you spam click the plus button it won't increase the speed 💀
- NOTE: idk if the codes works for others if there is a pairing process
