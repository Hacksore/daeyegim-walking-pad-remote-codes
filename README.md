# daeyegim-walking-pad-remote-codes

I lost the remote so I'm uploading the codes here for other people who might need it.


### How to pair the remote
Power on the walking pad while holding the start button for 5 seconds and it should beep.


### Recording
```
+ 
-
left 
right
M
Start
Stop
```

### TODO
- Somehow make the remote responsive, when you spam click the plus button it won't increase the speed ðŸ’€
    - [a good suggestion on the discord](https://discord.com/channels/740930220399525928/954422680969445377/1224062984016494652) was record up and down with a few spam clicks so one press will move the walking pad up/down by .5 units
- NOTE: idk if the codes works for others if there is a pairing process
